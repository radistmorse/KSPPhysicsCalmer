# KSPPhysicsCalmer
Physics Calmer mod for KSP. This mod disables the crash damage and joints breaking for 5 seconds after the flight scene load. This should be enough for all the wobbling, caused by the drop of your craft, to calm.

## Install
Just copy the dll file into your GameData folder.

## Usage
Nothing is needed from you. You won't even notice it's there.
